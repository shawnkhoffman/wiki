## 1.1 The Elements of Programming

Every powerful language has three mechanisms for combining simple ideas to form more complex ideas:

- **Primitive expressions**, which represent the simplest entities the language is concerned with.
  - i.e., *a string, an integer, a boolean,* etc.
- **Means of combination**, by which compound elements are built from simpler ones.
  - i.e., *operators* such as *+, -, /,* etc.
- **Means of abstraction**, by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units.
  - i.e., *variables, functions* and *classes.*

Any powerful programming language should be able to describe primitive data and primitive procedures and should have methods for combining and abstracting procedures and data.
